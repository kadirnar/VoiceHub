# `asr_nemotron` model guide

## Overview

`asr_nemotron` is a VoiceHub **automatic speech recognition**
integration. This page is generated from the model registry and its executable
data and training contracts, so the documented support stays aligned with code. [Open the `asr_nemotron` Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/kadirnar/voicehub/blob/main/notebooks/models/asr_nemotron.ipynb).

## Quickstart

```bash
python -m pip install voicehub
```

1. Install VoiceHub and the provider extra shown above.
2. Choose a checkpoint that matches this integration.
3. Place a supported recording at `speech.wav`.
4. Transcribe it and inspect both the full text and timed segments.

```python
from voicehub import AutoModelForSpeechRecognition

model = AutoModelForSpeechRecognition.from_pretrained(
    'nvidia/nemotron-3.5-asr-streaming-0.6b',
    model_type='asr_nemotron',
    device="cuda",
    lazy_load=True,
)
output = model.transcribe("speech.wav")
print(output.text)
for segment in output.segments:
    print(segment.start, segment.end, segment.text)
```

Use only authorized recordings for reference voice, transcription, detection,
or evaluation. The example selects a concrete device; verify checkpoint-specific
hardware needs and pin an immutable revision before production use.

## Supported tasks and capabilities

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Task | Automatic speech recognition |
| Architecture | `nemotron-3.5-rnnt` |
| Runtime | `VoiceHub-native` |
| Capabilities | `automatic-speech-recognition`, `multilingual`, `language-identification`, `timestamps`, `streaming-architecture`, `safetensors`, `fine-tuning`, `voicehub-native`, `native-runtime` |
| Reusable components | — |

### Data contract

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Readiness | `integrated-raw` |
| Data architecture | `rnnt` |
| Sample rate | 16,000 Hz |
| Contract getter | `get_asr_dataset_spec('asr_nemotron')` |

| Variant | Required fields | One of | Boundary | Other rules |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `raw-audio` | `audio` | text / transcription / transcript | Source | at most one: text / transcription / transcript |
| `nemotron-rnnt-model-ready` | `input_features`, `attention_mask`, `prompt_ids`, `labels`, `label_lengths`, `decoder_input_ids` | — | Prepared | — |

Language-prompted Nemotron RNN-T fine-tuning records. Follow the [shared data workflow](../../guides/speech-data.md) for
manifest loading, audio validation, leakage-safe splits, and model-owned
preprocessing.

## Checkpoints, provenance, and license

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Default checkpoint | [`nvidia/nemotron-3.5-asr-streaming-0.6b`](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/nemotron-3.5-asr-streaming-0.6b) |
| Checkpoint status | Registry default; pin an immutable revision for production and reproducible evidence |
| Implementation | `voicehub.models.asr_nemotron.modeling_asr_nemotron.NemotronForSpeechRecognition` |
| Configuration | `voicehub.models.asr_nemotron.configuration_asr_nemotron.NemotronASRConfig` |
| Source provenance | `voicehub/architectures/nemotron_asr/SOURCE.json` |
| License | [OpenMDW-1.1](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/nemotron-3.5-asr-streaming-0.6b) |

Use of the checkpoint and derivatives is governed by the OpenMDW-1.1 license. Commercial use: **allowed by the registered terms**.

The default checkpoint identifies the expected family, not every compatible
variant. Confirm the selected checkpoint's revision, access terms, provenance,
and license before downloading or redistributing it.

## Optimization and training support

All public optimizations enter this model through the shared
`BaseSpeechModel` lifecycle. Use `available_optimization_passes()` to discover
the public pass registry, then apply, inspect, serialize, or restore a plan
through the common model API. Application remains fail-closed when the active
runtime or hardware cannot satisfy a pass.

### Training contract

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Support | `native` |
| Family | `rnnt` |
| Recipe | `single-phase` |
| Default phase | `speech_recognition` |
| Training checkpoint | `nvidia/nemotron-3.5-asr-streaming-0.6b` |
| Native training graph | `yes` |

| Phase | Kind | Components | Required inputs | Loss keys |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `speech_recognition` | objective | `model.encoder`, `model.encoder_projector`, `model.prompt_projector`, `model.decoder`, `model.joint` | `input_features`, `attention_mask`, `prompt_ids`, `labels`, `label_lengths`, `decoder_input_ids` | `loss` |

The integration accepts its declared source or prepared contract directly. Call `model.validate_training_support()` before constructing a
trainer. Follow the [shared training workflow](../../guides/training.md) for a
one-step smoke test, validation, checkpoint resume, optimization, and portable
export.
